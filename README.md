## HOW TO PLAY?
The player is required to complete 12 levels, with a tutor appearing every 3 or 4 levels to instruct the student (the player) on a new mathematical topic.
After acquiring the theoretical knowledge of the new subject, the player must confront an enemy in a card game, which they must defeat before depleting all their lives. Each card possesses an attack value that is inflicted upon the enemy, energy that is consumed upon usage, a shield that provides protection to the main character, and lives that restore the playerâ€™s health. To use these cards, the player must accurately solve a mathematical equation related to the recently covered topic.
A turn concludes when the player presses the "T" key (TERMINATE TURN), after which the enemy will attack the player.
